<h2 id="capstone-proposal">Capstone Proposal</h2>
<p>Carlos Santillan</p>
<p>May 7, 2021</p>
<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
<p>For the capstopne project for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree, I have selected the classification of dog images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).</p>
<h3 id="domain-background">Domain Background</h3>
<p>Image classification is a common Machine Learning task, for this project we will be using different ML techniques and will compare the results obtained from them.</p>
<p>We wil use different techniques to build an image classifier that will determine if an image a dog, and if possible the breed of the dog.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to evaluate different machine learning techniques, and compare and constrating. In order to do this I will use pre trained models, create a cnn from scratch and finally apply transfer learning techniques.</p>
<p>I will use VGG-16 model pre trained against the ImageNet dataset to build a dog classifer. We will also create a CNN from scratch and train it with the Dog dataset, finally we wil use transfer learning to train a model</p>

<h3 id="datasets-and-inputs">Datasets and Inputs</h3>
<p>The data set provided contains a training dataset that includes 8,351 dog images.
The dog images includes multiple images of dogs each folder corresponding to a different dog breed</p>
<h3 id="solution-statement">Solution Statement</h3>
<p>In this project, I will use use different techniques to solve the problem.
I will create a CNN from scratch and train it with the Dog dataset, finally I wil use transfer learning to train a model from scratch</p>
<h3 id="benchmark-model">Benchmark Model</h3>
<p>I will use the VGG-16 model as my benchmark model, the model is capable of identifying 118 dog breeds.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation-metrics">Evaluation Metrics</h3>
<p>This is a simple classification problem, we can use classification metrics such as Accuracy, Recall and  F1 score along with confusion matrix to visualize the results.</p>
<h3 id="project-design">Project Design</h3>
<p>In order to accomplish the goals outlined for this project we will build a data pipeline that can perform the pre processing required for the images. Such has image resizing, converting all images to gray scale.
Also we will need to create function that will output the evaluation metrics for all the models used so that the results of the different models can be compared.
I will need to determine if GPU is required for the project or if CPU is enough to perform the required training, if a GPU is required I will use AWS Sagemaker notebook instance to perform the training on Amazon.</p>
