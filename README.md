June 12, 2021


System Requirements

Tensorflow 2.5 
Tensorflow-Datasets 4.3.0 [Install](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-datasets/)

## Dataset 
```
The Stanford Dogs dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. There are 20,580 images, out of which 12,000 are used for training and 8,580 for testing. Class labels and bounding box annotations are provided for all the 12,000 images.
```


For this project I will be using the publicly available dataset standford, provided as a tensorflow Dataset. The dataset has been pre split into a training and test dataset.
